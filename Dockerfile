# ============================================================================
# comfyui-minimax template image, built FROM the shared base
# (hearmeman/comfyui-base, comfyui-runtime/base/Dockerfile).
#
# The base owns: python 3.12 + /opt/venv (on PATH), the pinned torch trio +
# /torch-constraint.txt applied via ENV PIP_CONSTRAINT, pip tooling, pyyaml/
# gdown/triton/jupyterlab, huggingface_hub + hf_xet, opencv-python, ComfyUI
# pinned at COMFYUI_REF (v0.32.0, which ships the MiniMax-H3 core nodes and
# the comfy-kitchen int8 attention wiring) with /comfyui-approved-ref,
# ComfyUI-Manager, both SageAttention wheels under /opt/sage/, the CivitAI
# downloader, and ENV ORT_INDEX_ARGS (the per-CUDA-variant onnxruntime index
# nuance).
#
# This layer adds ONLY the minimax node set, the onnxruntime-gpu reassert, and
# the entrypoint. BASE_IMAGE is passed by CI from pins.json's "base_image";
# the default below mirrors that pin so a plain build stays coherent.

FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}

# The minimax node set, culled 2026-08-13 to the packs the 5 shipped workflows
# actually resolve nodes from. Four packs ARE load-bearing for the bundled
# T2V/I2V workflows: KJNodes (ModelPreviewOverrideKJ, StringConstant,
# SomethingToString), rgthree (Power Lora Loader, Display Any),
# VideoHelperSuite (VHS_VideoCombine) and Openrouter_node (the OpenRouterNode
# inside the Auto Prompt subgraph; its API key is user-supplied via widget,
# LLM_KEY, or a JSON file in the node dir, never baked). The stock r2v
# workflow needs none of these: every node type in it resolves to ComfyUI
# core.
#
# ComfyUI-Spectrum-MiniMax-H3 is an optional accelerator, not load-bearing:
# it forecasts post-transformer features with Chebyshev ridge regression to
# skip transformer evaluations, and adds one node (Spectrum Apply MiniMax H3,
# under sampling/spectrum). Baked in because it is not registered in
# ComfyUI-Manager's default channel, which puts it on the "high risk" install
# path, and that path needs allow_git_url_install AND a loopback listener, so
# it is permanently unreachable from Manager on a pod (ComfyUI runs with
# --listen). It needs ComfyUI >= e377e263 (in v0.31.0) for the latent_shapes
# argument on outer_sample; the base's v0.32.0 pin satisfies that floor.
# Output is approximate by design, so it is off unless a graph adds the node.
#
# No ADD cache-buster: none of these packs version-gates a model release, so
# pack HEADs freeze in the layer cache until this loop line changes, the same
# deliberate shape as the previous minimax image.
# PIP_CONSTRAINT (base-owned) applies to every requirements install below.
